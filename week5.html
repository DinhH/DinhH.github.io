  					<p><h4>
							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>This was one crazy week. I needed to finish the Netflix project and start to prepare for upcoming job interviews.
								My partner and I spent about 18 hours working on this project together and we were able to finished it with the RMSE of 0.97.
								I also attended the career fair on Tuesday and that was exhausting. I spoke to several companies and I thought it went quite well.
								I also spent a lot of time listening to other people conversation and try to improve my own. I'm glad that this week is over.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>My partner and I struggled a little to finish the project because we couldn't figure out how to read the caches and get it to work for
								travis-ci. Our code produced a RMSE of .97. We wrote many unit tests and acceptance tests that satisfied our methods. I also want to focus on
								my interview skill before my first interview next week. I need to freshen up on the logic and data structures.</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
							<br>Next week, I will have to focus on the interviews. I also want to start studying for the test. Since I didn't get a great score on my collatz project,
							I'm aiming for a high grade on the first test. </br>
							<br>Pick of the week</br>
								<br>My pick of the week is the news about Yahoo's security breach. 500 million accounts were stolen back in late 2014. Many of those account information may have
								included names, email addresses and hashed passwords. In some cases, the encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. Some reports criticised Yahoo for
								not inform the public right away. Many believe that if Yahoo knew about this since early August, they have failed to coordinate with law enforcement. This is not Yahoo
								first security breach, you would think as one of the world leading sites, protecting user's details would be their number one priority.</br>
