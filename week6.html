							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>This past week I focused on reviewing most of the materials for the upcoming exam. I went through most of the code that we've discussed
							in class and tried to walk through it myself. I started to look at constructors and destructors. I also went back and re-read some of the readings that I didn't get a complete grasp on. While studying
							by myself, I realized it might be better to study with a buddy.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>One of the challenges I faced was trying to produce my own code while trying to learn the concepts, especially with the reference, pointers, and
							 	exceptions. I understand that the best way to see how the code works is to play around with it, but it's quite difficult. I'm also have to balance tests, programming and
							 	interviews so it will hard to prioritize. I'm also not sure about the style of the test so studying will be a little harder.</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
							<br>This coming up week is going to be hell. It consists of interviews, tests, and programming. However, I can relax and enjoy ACL on the weekend (hopefully). But the plans are
						 	to first finish my big data program since it's due on Tuesday. I will also study for OOP's test in between then really focus on studying after the program is turned-in.
							I also have a couple of interviews I need to aced. And after all that madness, I can finally enjoy my days at Zilker Park for ACL.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>Start doing projects that combined your passion and programming. A couple of years ago, someone asked me "What's your passion for life?" My response was "Cooking and Coding, the double C's!"
								Then I thought to myself, why not combine those two? So I did. I started a cooking blog, recipes site of all of my favorite dishes and what I thought about it. It started as a small and silly
								project but now I found myself constantly making posts and I actually got responses from people. So I would advise you to do the same. Find your passions (If you haven't already) and combine them
							 	together. You will be surprise of the result! Besides, recruiters always love to see personality and who you are when you're not focusing on work.</br>
