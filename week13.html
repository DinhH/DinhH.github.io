							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>My partner and I finished out project earlier this week. In class, we learn about dyamic_cast. It was a bit tricky
							 	to understand. From my understanding about "cast's error", unlike the other three type of casts, a cast to pointer will give back a null pointer,
								and a cast to a reference, on an error, it will throw a bad exception. Clearly, I need to go over that concept again.
								We also talked about cloning in C++. Making a polymorphic equals method by calling a virtual clone method from equal.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>Like I mentioned before, my partner and I finished the project early, we didn't run into any major problem this week. The most frustrating
								thing was writings the acceptance and unit tests. And since I also have other homework and programs for my other classes, it was difficult to
								concentrate on just one class, instead, I have to jump from one assignment to another. </br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
								<br>This next week will be a good one because it's Thanksgiving week. We have Wednesday off and I'll be at home cooking. As much as I want to,
								I know that I still have a lot of work to do during this break since next week is the last week of class and for me, I don't have any "final"
								during final week but all of my finals will be during that last week of school. I'm definitely not looking forward to that. However, I'm looking
								forward to spending some quality time with my family and be thankful for everything they have done for me.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>If you haven't heard of TED Talks, you should definitely check it out. It's a website where innovators from every aspect of life present their
								findings and how it can change the world. There are talks from cancer research to thrones demo and social networks. I love TED Talks because it's definitely
							 	educational but it's also good to think about what's going on around the world around us. Especially I'm the kind of programmer that need background noise
								while I code so I usually have TED open in the back. If you have a chance, check it out and I'm sure it will change your life!</br>
