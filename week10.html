							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>This past week my partner and I started working on the Darwin project. We knew that this will be a challenging project because of its
								complexities. We believed that we have a good enough understanding of the project to get going. I also had couple of homeworks and a big data
								program to finished. I also went to an on-site interview for a full time position on Friday. I also have some plans for this Halloween weekend.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>There're a lot of challenges that we're anticipating in this project. We're still trying to design the construction for the species class, creature class and the main
								Darwin class. We're also a bit confused on how we will execute the function calls for each of those classes.  </br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
								<br>Next week will be a sprint to the finish line for the project. We're aiming to finish on time but both of us are busy but we're meeting and work on it
								anytime we're free. I also have to finish homeworks for my other classes. But my main focus if to finish the project early and attempt to implement the
								extra credit for creating the best creature.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>We all need a break sometimes. One way I like to relax is playing a game called BlackBox. It's an IOS application that was introduced to me by a friend. It is
								a strategy game that forces you to think and come up with a solution to each puzzle. Most of the puzzles does not require you to touch the screen, it's all about
								thinking and trial and error. Everyone that I have introduced the game to totally loved it. The one thing that impressed me the most is it was developed and own
								by one guy who started as a hobby. So if you are looking for a new, challenging game to take your mind off of the busy school work, BlackBox is a great game.</br>
