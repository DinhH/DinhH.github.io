							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>After enjoying the awesome music at ACL, this past week was a little more calm for me. Mostly homeworks, and getting started on the new allocation project. Although I had a theory of computation test on Tuesday, I thought it went quite well and I felt as if I was a little more prepared than the last exam. My partner and I also started project 3 on Wednesday, we read through the documents and finished the first function on Thursday. Hopefully we can it done early next week. On a happier note, Texas football also won on Saturday, their first Big 12 game!  </br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br> So far, the project hasn't giving us any problem yet. We finished the valid function and the rest of the project should be somewhat comprehensive to figure out. We might run into a little trouble when writing the test cases but other than that, I don't think we will have any big problem with the project. As for my test, one of the biggest trouble will be memorizing all of the cryptography's attacks and algorithms. </br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
							<br>As I mentioned earlier, we’re hoping to finish the program earlier next week. I also have a midterm for cryptography that would take most of my time. But the highlight of my week will be the Texas women’s volleyball game since they will be celebrating breast cancer awareness month. This is one of my favorite sporting events at UT since it combined two of my favorite things. If any of you have time, it would be a great event to enjoy your Wednesday night.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>If there’s only one thing I can tell you about myself, I would tell you that I am a fighter against cancer. I believe that the battle against cancer is not just for those who are diagnosed, but it’s a battle for all of us. Many people in my life was affected by this disease and I'm fighting it with them. So my tip of the week is find a purpose that’s worth fighting for. Either it’s politics, education or world peace, find a something that you enjoy and feel strongly for. It will add purpose to your life and others around you. Besides, sometimes, you need to be away from school work and do something you’re passionate about. It has been working out quite well for me so I hope you will find a purpose to fight for.</br>
