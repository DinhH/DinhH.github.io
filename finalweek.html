							<br>Everything I have learned from this class!</br>
								<br>Was taking this class my first choice? No. But I'm so glad that I did. At the beginning of this semester, I needed a
							 	4th CS class and there weren't that many options left so I picked OOP. Knowing that this wasn't going to be easy, I was determined
								to make the most out of it. Since I came into the class late, it took me a while to catch up with the rest of the class.</br>


								<br>I can't say that being called randomly in class is my favorite part but as it progresses, it wasn't too bad. Over time, I found myself learning
								the concepts a little bit better when Downing called on me and I didn't know the answer because now it's engraved in my brain. I also didn't like
								the quizzes that much. It's a great way to test your knowledge about the concepts we learned the class before but I found pressured under the amount
								of time we are given. 3 minutes isn't that much time. But I appreciate the quizzes because it's the indication of what I should go back and review if I didn't
								get it right.</br>


								<br>Another thing I appreciate about this course is how we practiced how to be a programmer just like in the real world. From git control to working with a partner,
								this give us a chance to get yourself ready. And I also enjoyed the guests' presentation about their company and my favorite is the one about Mars from JPL with Alex Menzies.
								What I took away from all of those talks is that one day I can potentially be as cool as they are. I love working with a different partner every project. I quickly came
								to realized that everyone has a different way of writing code. Each person has a different approach and their style of coding also varies. I learn a lot about
								myself and how I can adapt to those changes.</br>


								<br>I have to say, the best thing about this course is probably professor Downing. He has a way with explaining the concepts that made it easier to understand. And since
								he appreciates the value of mimicking the real world practices, he wants us to be ready and actually be great programmers. And I have to give him some credits for his
								jokes. They are quite funny especially when he use it to described a concept.</br>

								<br>Overall, I learned a lot from this class. Learned a lot about myself as a programmer and how cool C++ is. As I enter the workforce, I will take a lot of the things I learned
								here into practice. I'm highly recommend this class for any of your who are thinking about taking it. You will struggle (or not) but you will learn a ton.</br>
