							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br> This past week, I concentrated on starting the new Netflix project. For the project, we needed to calculate the
								RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) from the movies ratings from Netflix. I will be working with a partner for this project.
								We focused on writing the algorithm for parsing the data and how to read 1.5Gb of data quickly. We also started to implement the
								calculation for RMSE. </br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>One of the biggest problem we have is reading the data quick enough. Since we have to stay within the time limit of 1 minute,
								our concern is that we can't read the data fast enough to get all the data we needed for the calculation. We might also run into the
							 	problem of making an accurate prediction. Since the calculation measure the "rate of difference", we're concerned that we won't meet
								the requirement of staying under 1.00.</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
								<br>This coming up week is going to be exciting. The project is due on Thursday and I'll be attending the career fair on Tuesday.
								I love going to the fair, I get to meet a lot of interesting people who work in the industry. I've scored a couple of internships and
								full-time offers. This time, I'm going to look for something different, something that will push me to learn new things.</br>
							<br>Pick of the week.</br>
								<br>I was on my way to class on day, and I overheard a conversation between two students about the Presidential Debate. One guy said
								"There are a lot of engineer students who don't follow politics." That used to be me. I didn't follow politics until I was a sophomore
								in college and I can vouch for that those two students said. Not a lot of my friends follow politics. So I would strongly encourage everyone
								to watch the Presidential Debate this month. I believe what we all have a duty to contribute to our country and it is always important to have a
							  voice. Besides, I always find those debate to be really enjoyable and it's a great to see where our country is heading.</br>
