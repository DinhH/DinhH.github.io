							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br> During the first week of class, unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend class because
								I wasn't officially enrolled. The start of this semester has been quite crazy for me.
								I was on couple of waitlists for a 4th CS class. Long story short, I decided to enrolled in this course much later than most students.
								With that in mind, I will continue this blog talking about my first week experience and not specifically about this course alone.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>One of the most challenging tasks for me this week was getting organize. I needed to find the balance between scheduling time for studying and time for my part-time
								job. I also struggle a little with keeping up with class work, notes and office hours. Even though I understand that this problem can easily be fixed with
							 		a calendar, I still find it a little difficult.</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
							<br> "Next week" would bring me to right now as I completing this blog. During my second week of school. After my class schedule was set, I found it a little bit
								easier to keep up with everything. I now able to have a fixed schedule that I can follow. I also worked on being more vocal and social. I've realized that
								having a couple of buddies in every class makes a big difference on staying on track. </br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>My tip of the week is get involve in hackathons. There is an event coming up on October 22-23rd at UT called HackTX. I've attended this hackathon for the past
							 	2 years. You get to work on your own project, with a team of your choice and win prizes. Also at the event, there are recruiters and companies with technology
								that you can use like API and super cool hardwares. There are also mentors from different companies volunteered to share their knowledge in case you
							 	need assistance. Hackathon is one of best ways to get real-world experience while still in school.</br>
