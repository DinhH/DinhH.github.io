  					<p><h4>
							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>  This week I spent a lot of time working on the first project. We were asked to implement the collatz problem.
								After I finished the project, there were also a lot of small details I need to pay attention to. We need to make sure that Travis-ci
								is working after every push. And I was really careful on submitting the required files. In class, we also look at exception calls and
								in C++. </br>

							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br> One of the biggest challenge I have was getting the cache to work correctly for the project. I also didn't know that I was required to
								submit a .Json file on Canvas so I ended up turned it in late. And after Friday's quiz, I need to work on pointer reference and what "&" do when you
								do a function call. </br>

						<br>What will you do next week?</br>
							<br>  This coming week, I will try to get started on the next project with my partner. I will catch up on some readings and look at some of the
							sample codes. I will also get ready for the career fair coming up on the 20th. I'm looking for a full-time position so I really need to polish my
							my interview techniques. </br>

						<br>Pick of the week.</br>
								<br>This pick of the week for me is the Grace Hopper Conference for women in computing which will take place in Houston for the second time in a row.
								I was honored and privileged to have attended this awesome conference for the past 3 years. At this conference, you get to meet some of the most influential
								women in tech. All most all of their talks are eye-opening and impactful. So if you get the chance to attend this conference, I highly reccomended.</b>
