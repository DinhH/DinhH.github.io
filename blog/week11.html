							What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>This past week, my partner and I worked to finish the project. Surprisingly, I was able to get all of my assignments done and on time. I went to
								Adele concert which was amazing. I bought the ticket almost a year ago and listening to her sings live was absolutely incredible. I also went to the Illusionists
								magic show at Bass hall. That was also an amazing show. I was speechless and bewilder by all the tricks they did.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>There were quite a bit of problems stood in our way for this past project. First we couldn't get the creatures to move correctly and we couldn't print the board.
								While coding I got the "tunnel vision" and it was difficult to find the bugs that were causing problems. But luckily, I have a great partner!</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
								<br>I guess I can take this next week a bit easy. I don't have any tests so I should have more time to review the materials we talked about in class. So this week I'm
								aiming to get all my assignments done and on time.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>Tip of the week this week is based on what happened to me during the project, "tunnel vision". I'm sure any of you who had spent hours of coding came across this
								problem before and I'm sure it was not a pleasant experience. For me, it was helpful to stop and take a break, distract your eyes with something different than coding.
								Also talking through your code with someone can also bring out the bug. In addition to that, you can always have the rubber duck debugging technique!
