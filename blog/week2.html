              <br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>  When I was officially enrolled in the class on Thursday, I spent a lot of time trying to catch up for this class.
                Since I missed 4 lectures days, I had to prepare Github, read up on materials, and get started on the first coding assignment.
                For the project, I've never used docker before, it was a new experience for me. Since object oriented programming is a new subject for me,
                I also spent a lot of time looking at the examples professor Downing went over in class to set some sense of what I should be expecting
                for my first lecture day.</br>

							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>  One of the biggest challenge I overcame this week was setting up the project. While installing docker and trying to get the project
                running, I had a lot of little bugs that took a while to figure out. But now that I have the project up and running, the next challenge for me
                is implementing the cache for the collatz project.</br>

						<br>What will you do next week?</br>
							<brl>  Most of next week I will be working on the project. My plan is to start with the most obvious solution of collatz and try
              to improve it run time. I will focus on getting the cache to work since that to be is my biggest challenge.</br>

						<br>Pick of the week.</br>
								<br>  There are some talk this week about the development of Elon Musk Hyperloop. If you don't already know what it is, hyperloop an idea founded <body>
								  Tesla's founder Elon Musk. He has the vision to move people or things anywhere in the world quickly, safely, efficiently, on-demand and with minimal
                  impact to the environment. When he said "quickly", it means you can travel from California to New York in under an hour. Right now, there has been designs
                  submitted by college students all around the country proving that Elon's idea is actually doable.</b>
