							What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>This past week we talked about the different types of compile-time and run-time analysis that can be done on objects, including the dynamic_cast and static_cast functions.
							 	We also learned about inheritance and the the C++ rules that apply to classes and subclasses. Besides OOP, I also had a chance to catch up on my other classes. I found this past
							 	week to a little less stressful in term of tests and materials. I also had the chance to watch the UT women's volleyball team beat Baylor Univ</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>We're running into a bit of problems with our constructors for the project. We also just finished figuring out how to implement the checking of the neighboring cells.
								But now, my partner and I are trying to figure out why our Conway cells aren't moving correctly and we're 50% certain that we aren't counting the neighbors correctly.
								We also trying to figure out the best way to print the boards in intervals and a specific round of the simulation. Other than that, we should be done soon.</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
								<br>This week is actually really busy for me. All my programs and homeworks are due this week (luckily not on the same day!). My partner and I would like to finish
								this project before Thursday and give ourselves some room for any "emergency bugs". I will also try to finish everything I need to do before leaving for the Thanksgiving
							 	break.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>Tip of the week is actually pretty new to me too. If any of you are using Atom text editor, there's a package called <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair">Atom Pair</a>
								that allows you and your partner to see live changes to the code. You can share your project and any live changes to the project will show for all of you
								who has the right to the pairing project. This is useful because pair programming is so much easier. However, this is a new package so personally I still think
								there are some minor bugs. But so far, it has impressed me for this project so far. Definitely worth checking it out.</br>
