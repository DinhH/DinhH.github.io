							<br>What did you do this past week?</br>
								<br>This past week I was focused on my cryptography test, finishing up the allocator project and a couple of other things for the
								rest of my classes. This weekend was a little hectic for me, I attended my first ever F1 event on Friday. I took my friend who just moved
								from Houston on an Austin hike on Saturday, and my parents came to visit me on Sunday. I realized earlier this week that I like to have
							 	a "busy life" I want my life to be balanced between school work, having fun with friends and have some time for myself. So for most of this
								week, I tried to work on that. As I look thought about this past week now, I think I did pretty well.</br>
							<br>What's in your way?</br>
								<br>This allocator project was straightforward and it didn't give us many problems. The biggest challenge we had was writing the units tests
							 	and we were able to figured it out after a bit of thinking. But overall, I think one big thing that stood in my way this week was timing.
								I was able to space everything I needed to complete pretty well it still feel like I could do a bit better.</br>
							<br>What will you do next week?</br>
								<br>I've heard that this next Darwin project is quite difficult so my partner and I are trying to start early and hopefully to finished on time.
								Luckily I don't have any midterm however, I still have a Big Data program to finish and a couple of homeworks to turn-in. Other than that, this
								coming week should be smooth sailing.</br>
							<br>Tip of the week.</br>
								<br>My tip of week is find some time for yourself. College can be very stressful at times but if you surround yourself with the right people and
							 	find time to do things that can take your mind off of school work and all the stressful things, you will enjoy the experience a little more. I know
								that works pretty well for me. Especially in Austin, there are something fun to do every week for everybody. You can drive half an hour from campus
								and be surrounded by the wonderful nature that's Barton Springs. And usually every weekend, there's always some events going on. This past weekend
								it was the F1 race and in a couple of weeks, it will be SXSW. So whatever your hobby might be, you should find time to distract yourself from
								the dreadful homeworks and the abundant programs you have to write!</br>
